## Installation

**Clone the Repository**

First, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

### ` git clone <repository-url> `

**Navigate to the Project Directory**

Change your current directory to the project's root folder. This step is important because it ensures that you are working within the correct project context. You can use the following command: 

### ` cd <project-path> `

**Install Dependencies**

## Start the Development Server

To begin developing your React application locally, you can start the development server.

### ` npm start `

The development server will launch your React application in a web browser, and you can access it at http://localhost:3000. As you make changes to your code, the server will automatically update the application in the browser without requiring manual refreshes.
Keep the terminal or command prompt window running while you're working on your project to take advantage of these development server features.
